# Project Explanation

This project was created as a **frontend test assignment** built with **React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS**.  
The goal was to demonstrate clean component architecture, state management, and responsive UI design using modern frontend tools.

---

## 🎯 Design & Interaction Decisions

1. **React with TypeScript**
   - Ensures type safety and code reliability.
   - Makes components self-documented through props and types.

2. **Tailwind CSS**
   - Used for rapid UI prototyping and consistent design system.
   - Reduces dependency on external UI libraries.
   - Responsive behavior is achieved using Tailwind’s breakpoint utilities.

3. **Vite as the Build Tool**
   - Provides a faster hot-reload experience compared to Create React App.
   - Optimized for production automatically.

4. **Component-driven architecture**
   - Each UI element (e.g., button, card, form input) is separated into reusable React components.
   - Encourages isolation and reusability.

5. **Page-based Routing**
   - The `pages/` folder defines main application views.
   - Optional navigation or route transitions could be implemented using React Router if required.

## ⚙️ Optional Enhancements Implemented

- **Responsive Layout:**  
  Tailwind’s grid and flex utilities used to ensure views scale across screen sizes.

- **Reusable UI Components:**  
  Buttons, cards, and modals created for modular usage.

- **Dark Mode Ready (Optional):**  
  Tailwind’s dark variant can be enabled easily if required.

- **Vercel Configuration:**  
  The included `vercel.json` enables smooth CI/CD deployment.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

The project emphasizes:
- Clean and maintainable frontend code
- Performance and scalability
- Readable and well-documented structure
